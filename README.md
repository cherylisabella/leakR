# leakR: Universal Data Leakage Detector for R  

Welcome to **leakR**, an R package designed to help researchers, data scientists, and machine learning practitioners rigorously detect and diagnose **data leakage** in their workflows.  

Data leakage is a pervasive yet often overlooked issue that undermines the integrity and reproducibility of predictive models by allowing unintended information to “leak” between training and testing phases.  

**leakR** provides a modular, extensible toolkit for detecting the most common and impactful forms of leakage, starting with tabular data contamination, target leakage, and temporal misalignments, while laying the foundation for a universal leakage detection framework across diverse data domains.

## Why leakR?  

- Automates leakage detection, filling a key methodological gap.  
- Designed for clarity, reproducibility, and transparent ML research.  
- Modular architecture supports gradual expansion (time series, NLP, images).  
- Useful for both academic and industry workflows.

## Features  

- Detects:  
  - Train/test contamination  
  - Target leakage  
  - Duplicate rows/records  
  - Temporal misalignments  
- Provides **visual summaries** of suspicious patterns.  
- Generates **detailed leakage reports** for audits or publications.  
- Offers clean APIs for seamless integration into ML workflows.  
- Includes **example vignettes** demonstrating leakage phenomena with code illustrations.

## Roadmap  

- **Phase 1**: Core tabular leakage detectors.  
- **Phase 2**: Time series leakage detection.  
- **Phase 3**: Domain-specific extensions (NLP, image pipelines).  
- **Phase 4**: Pipeline integration and multi-language support.
